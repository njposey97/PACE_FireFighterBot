# PACE_SumoBot
# Sumo_Cum_Laude
This project involves using an Arduino microcontroller as the main decision making device for an autonomous "Sumo bot" 
for the RoboGames competition.  

This project is still in progress and any code that has been used from other sources will 
be cited.  

This project is being funded by California State University Fullerton Partnership of Applied Computer Engineering and 
involves a team of computer engineering students creating the robot from design specifications through 
testing, programming, and hardware 
design in order to compete in competitions and lay the ground work for future teams who wish to compete.
